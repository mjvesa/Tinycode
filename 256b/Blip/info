      Another 256b intro for you people. This thing kindof participated
      in the intro competition at Stream'03 and got fift. Out of five, yay.

      The intro was built around a very small plasma and a landscape
      routine. After a bit of optimization I managed to cram them into 256
      bytes, but lost some of the coolness of the plasma in the work... The
      landscape routine is based on the voxel routine used in the first
      effect of my 4k intro, motion sickness. And the plasma routine is
      actually in turn based on the routine used to make the clouds in that
      very same part. Both of them were ofcourse optimized beyond sense and
      usability to fit them in 256 bytes. 


      Anyhow, Stream'03 was a cool party. Having seen the scene alive and
      well has given me some new motivation, and let's hope we'll see more
      intros from me in the future. Or hell, I don't know what you are hoping
      for in that respect ;)


      Take care.
